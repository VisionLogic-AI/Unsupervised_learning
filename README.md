# Unsupervised_learning
This repo is solely for showcasing various unsupervised learning projects piece by piece. Unsupervised learning is the ability for machine learning algorithms to find and understand patterns within data WITHOUT labels or guidance. The goal is to give the algorithms the ability to find find new patterns in the data from scratch.
